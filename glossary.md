# Glossary
  




### Ajax
 A web technology used to exchange data with a server to dynamically update parts of a web page (for example, forms) without needing entire page reloads. 

### Alias
 A user-friendly name to replace the internal [path](/docs/user_guide/en/glossary.html#glossary-path) that the system assigns to a [URL](/docs/user_guide/en/glossary.html#glossary-url) on the site. For example, you might assign an alias of */about* to the About page on your site, to replace the internal path */node/5*. This would give the page a URL of *http://example.com/about* instead of *http://example.com/node/5*. See [Section 5.1, “Concept: Paths, Aliases, and URLs”](/docs/user_guide/en/content-paths.html " Paths, Aliases, and URLs") for more information. 

### Anonymous

### Authenticated
 A person ([user](/docs/user_guide/en/glossary.html#glossary-user)) interacting with the site who is logged in. See [Section 7.1, “Concept: Users, Roles, and Permissions”](/docs/user_guide/en/user-concept.html " Users, Roles, and Permissions") for more information.

### Cache
 The site’s internal cache stores the output of time-consuming calculations, such as computing output for an HTML page request, and then retrieves them instead of recalculating the next time they are needed. External caching systems can also be used on the web server to speed up a site’s response. See [Section 12.1, “Concept: Cache”](/docs/user_guide/en/prevent-cache.html " Cache") for more information on the internal cache.

 A formatted listing of data; typically, the data comes from [content](/docs/user_guide/en/glossary.html#glossary-content)[entities](/docs/user_guide/en/glossary.html#glossary-entity). For example, on a farmers market site, you might create a [content item](/docs/user_guide/en/glossary.html#glossary-content-item) for each vendor. You could then make view that generates a listing page that shows a thumbnail image and short description of each vendor, linking to the full-page content item. Using the same data, you could also make a view that generates a new vendors block, which would show information from the most recently added vendors. See [Section 2.4, “Concept: Modular Content”](/docs/user_guide/en/planning-modular.html " Modular Content") for more information. 

### View mode
 A set of [field formatter](/docs/user_guide/en/glossary.html#glossary-field-formatter)[configuration](/docs/user_guide/en/glossary.html#glossary-configuration) for all of the [fields](/docs/user_guide/en/glossary.html#glossary-field) of a [content](/docs/user_guide/en/glossary.html#glossary-content)[entity](/docs/user_guide/en/glossary.html#glossary-entity), some of which may be hidden. Each [entity subtype](/docs/user_guide/en/glossary.html#glossary-entity-subtype) can have one or more view modes defined; for example, [content types](/docs/user_guide/en/glossary.html#glossary-content-type) typically have *Full* and *Teaser* view modes, where the *Teaser* view mode displays fewer or trimmed-down fields. See [Section 6.10, “Concept: View Modes and Formatters”](/docs/user_guide/en/structure-view-modes.html " View Modes and Formatters") for more information. 

### Vocabulary
 A group of [taxonomy terms](/docs/user_guide/en/glossary.html#glossary-taxonomy-term) to choose from when classifying [content](/docs/user_guide/en/glossary.html#glossary-content) in a particular way, such as the list of all of the vendor categories on a farmers market site. Technically, vocabularies are the [entity subtype](/docs/user_guide/en/glossary.html#glossary-entity-subtype) for the taxonomy term [entity type](/docs/user_guide/en/glossary.html#glossary-entity-type). See [Section 6.5, “Concept: Taxonomy”](/docs/user_guide/en/structure-taxonomy.html " Taxonomy") for more information.

### Wizard

For example, there are wizards for creating [views](/docs/user_guide/en/glossary.html#glossary-view) of different types. See [Section 9.3, “Creating a Content List View”](/docs/user_guide/en/views-create.html "9.3. Creating a Content List View") for more information. 

### WYSIWYG
 Acronym for *What You See is What You Get*, meaning a method for editing [content](/docs/user_guide/en/glossary.html#glossary-content) where what you see on the editing screen closely resembles the final product. See [Section 6.16, “Configuring Text Formats and Editors”](/docs/user_guide/en/structure-text-format-config.html "6.16. Configuring Text Formats and Editors") for more information.
